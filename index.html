										<h2>Daniel TCHASSI</h2>
										<p>About me</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										I am student in the Computer Science Departement of the <a href="https://polytechnique.cm/">National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaounde (Cameroon, Africa)</a>. The latter is the best engineering school of the CEMAC (which includes 6 countries).
										As part of my studies at engineering school, I acquired skills in both computer hardware and software development. I become familiar with hardware components such as processors, motherboards, memory, and peripherals. At the same time, I learned to program, design applications, and solve computer problems.<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										At the same time, I study operating systems, in particular the Linux system, with Professor <a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/"> <b> Alain Tchana </b></a> , University Professor at Ensimag - Grenoble INP - UGA - France.<br> 
										During my studies with Professor Alain Tchana, I deepened my knowledge of operating systems, particularly the Linux system. I gained a thorough understanding of various fundamental aspects of these systems.<br>
										Regarding the <b>management of virtual and physical memory</b>, I learned how operating systems handle and allocate memory for processes. I studied mechanisms such as paging and address translation from virtual to physical addresses, as well as the concepts of segmentation and paging to efficiently manage process memory.<br>
										In terms of <b>process management</b>, I learned how operating systems create, manage, and schedule processes. I studied the different states of a process, such as ready, running, and waiting, as well as context switching and process scheduling mechanisms to optimize resource utilization. <br>
										I also explored <b> system calls</b>, which allow programs to interact with the kernel of the operating system. I learned how to use system calls to perform operations such as file creation, memory allocation, file and directory management, and inter-process communication.<br>
										Working with Professor Alain Tchana provided me with the opportunity to deepen my theoretical knowledge in these areas and apply my skills through practical work and projects. I was able to develop applications using the features offered by operating systems, which helped me solidify my knowledge and enhance my skills in system programming.<br>
										The knowledge and skills I acquired in the field of operating systems, particularly with the Linux system, are valuable assets for my portfolio. They demonstrate my ability to comprehend and work with complex concepts, as well as my proficiency in the system development environment.
									</p>
									<h3>Extra Info</h3>
									<p>
										I like music, reading, sport like volleyBall and some more things.<br> 
										I am crypto enthusiastic and I like to learn more about cryptocurrencies because it will play an important role in the future

									<h3>Things I Can Do</h3>
									<p>Like any good polytechnician engineer, I certainly have skills and competencies centered around IT but I don't stop there only.</p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="icon solid fa-code">Program applications in C, JAVA, flutter, python, Arduino languages.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-terminal">Implement syscalls, add modules in the Linux kernel and customize it before compiling and installing it.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-code">Fully code an application in flutter using Firebase or other.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-folder-open">Study the project underlying a cryptocurrency in order to determine its relevance and establish an investment project</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-database">Design a mySQL database and maintain it. Also design applications in Java to manipulate the database.</li>

									<h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
									<p>During my career I had to carry out a few projects.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/TchassiDaniel/KALAN" class="image"><img src="images/KALAN.png" alt="Logo of KALAN project" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>KALAN for Google Development Solution Challenge</h4>
												<p> It was about coding an application that would allow us to fight against pollution to begin with and later extend to the fight against famine, and a decent job.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/TchassiDaniel/" class="image"><img src="images/OIP.jpg" alt="Linux kernel" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>PRACTICAL WORK ON LINUX KERNEL MANIPULATION</h4>
												<p>As part of the mentoring with Professor <a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/"> <b> Alain Tchana </b></a> , I carried out several Practical Work which generally consisted of implementing snippets of code in the Linux code before compiling it to study the latter. Also to design applications in userspace to exploit certain information delivered by the kernel and thus discover how we could optimize our applications.</p>
